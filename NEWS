v. 0.1.0, 2016-03-04:
	* get_dims should now respect aspect ratios set in global theme (#3).
	* new function `ggsave_fitmax` to save fixed-aspect plots without extra whitespace.
	* `png_ggsized` is deprecated. Use `ggsave_fitmax` instead.
	* Argument changes in `theme_ggEHD`:
		- Gains argument `base_family`, defaulting to "".
		- Loses `...`, which only worked for elements not set by the theme.
		- This means theme_ggEHD now takes the same arguments as the built-in ggplot themes.
		- If you want to pass additional arguments in `...`, use `theme_ggEHD()+theme(...)`.
v. 0.0.2, 2016-01-20:
	* Now compatible with ggplot2 >= 2.0 (1.0.x *should* still work, at least for now).
v. 0.0.1, 2015-10-01: 
	* Restructured previously existing code as an R package.
 	* Added new functions `get_dims` and `png_ggsized`.
